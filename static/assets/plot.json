    "text": "It is very dark. Cold and dark. You find yourself on an unfamiliar place at who knows what hours of the night, but you don't feel trapped at all. After all, you recall walking here by yourself earlier and could easily repeat it in reverse.\nBut, you're not so sure WHY you're here, and that frightens you. A whim? Did you just wander for hours without destination and just now noticed how lost you may be? Was this just an evening walk with one too many turns? The fact you can't remember how you got here unnerves you a lot more than your present location.\nYou should try to relax, you tell to yourself, no good decisions come from under stress. As your eyes slowly get used to the darkness, you decide to look up at the night sky. Just for a bit. If not to admire how many stars you can see here, wherever you are. And seeing them does help to ease, to reassure you truly aren't trapped away in some dark cave or something.\nYou focus on your hearing to better your bearings, as your eyes are still lagging behind in usefulness. Tree leaves whistle as some soft wind passes by. Crickets pepper the air all around, an owl hoots in the distance. And as seemingly far, you can listen to an occasional chugging of... car wheels on asphalt? Okay, that's good, there must be a road nearby! It seemed to come from your %c0%left%e%!\nMakes sense, that's the way you recall you took to get here.\nThe black outlines that surround you are not more than pine trees. And the hardness bellow your feet is of a dirt path you're in. You feel a bit more relieved at the tranquillity around you and the muted sounds of civilization, not too far away.\nWelp, you should probably get going. Or do something else than standing around in the adumbrate. What are you going to do?",
